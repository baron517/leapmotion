# Leap Motion Examples

This project has several examples that demonstrate how to use the Leap Motion JavaScript library. The `index.html` file implements a simple space game that the user can play by waving their finger in the air.

You can see a video of the game here: https://vimeo.com/90511441

The sprites used in the game originally came from Daniel Cook's [SpaceCute collection](https://vimeo.com/90511441). The background image is from the OpenGameArt [space game starter set](http://opengameart.org/content/space-game-starter-set).
